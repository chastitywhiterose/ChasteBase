What you see above is an HTML table representation of a Chess board. It is not perfect, but it is a convenient way to avoid the use of images when creating documentation on different Chess positions. Using plain text saves a lot of space compared to the space required to make millions of Chess images for every possible move. The white pieces are represented with capital letters and the black by lowercase letters.

Of course, I don't intend to document every move that could occur in every Chess game. Instead, I want to cover those that happen in real games with humans. The idea is approximately one blog post per day where I analyze the board from my human perspective and then write what I think the best move is.

Unlike a Chess engine, I can explain the reason for my moves in a position. This could be used for future Chess books after I have written good explanations of why I recommend a move in a given position.

In any case, my recommended move from the starting position will always be d4, which means move the pawn in front of the white queen to d4.

Later on, I may cover openings starting with e4, but because they are too popular and overused, I will be sticking with my openings beginning with d4. The idea is one post per day because this is a small step that is easy to fit into my busy schedule.

# 1. d4

|   | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | r | n | b | q | k | b | n | r |
| 7 | p | p | p | p | p | p | p | p |
| 6 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

| 4 |   |   |   | P |   |   |   |   |

| 2 | P | P | P |   | P | P | P | P |
| 1 | R | N | B | Q | K | B | N | R |

d4 is my favorite starting move for white because I am trying to launch into the Queen's Gambit or London System depending on what black does. The most common responses by black are d5 or Nf6. In either case, c4 is still a valid next move for white.

# 1. d4 d5

|   | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | r | n | b | q | k | b | n | r |
| 7 | p | p | p |   | p | p | p | p |
| 6 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 5 |   |   |   | p |   |   |   |   |
| 4 |   |   |   | P |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 2 | P | P | P |   | P | P | P | P |
| 1 | R | N | B | Q | K | B | N | R |

It makes sense for black to move their queen's pawn to d5 because the most common move would be king's pawn to e5 and that would allow white to capture the pawn with no consequence.

When this happens, my next move is always c4 which makes the queen's gambit.


# 1. d4 d5 2. c4

|   | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | r | n | b | q | k | b | n | r |
| 7 | p | p | p |   | p | p | p | p |
| 6 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 5 |   |   |   | p |   |   |   |   |
| 4 |   |   | P | P |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 2 | P | P |   |   | P | P | P | P |
| 1 | R | N | B | Q | K | B | N | R |


This position is called the Queen's Gambit. When this position occurs, the next move by black has all the power to decide the rest of the game. Black can take the pawn on c4 but this allows white to move the king's pawn to e4 and take full control of the center with both central pawns. Even e3 would not be a bad move in this case.

White can quickly find a way to take back the black pawn if this happens with the bishop or even the queen.

# 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6

|   | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | r | n | b | q | k | b | n | r |
| 7 | p | p | p |   |   | p | p | p |
| 6 |   |   |   |   | p |   |   |   |
| 5 |   |   |   | p |   |   |   |   |
| 4 |   |   | P | P |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 2 | P | P |   |   | P | P | P | P |
| 1 | R | N | B | Q | K | B | N | R |

This is the Queen's Gambit Declined. Black has moved their king's pawn 1 square to defend the d5 pawn in case white's c4 pawn captures it. However, this does come with the downside of blocking black's c file bishop.

What I recommend here is white knight to f3. The idea is to get it to the e5 square and trap that e6 pawn there permanently.
