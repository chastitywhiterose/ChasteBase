When this position occurs, the next move by black has all the power to decide the rest of the game. Black can take the pawn on c4 but this allows white to move the king's pawn to e4 and take full control of the center with both central pawns. Even e3 would not be a bad move in this case.

White can quickly find a way to take back the black pawn if this happens with the bishop or even the queen.
