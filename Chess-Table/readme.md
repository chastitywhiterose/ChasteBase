What you see above is an HTML table representation of a Chess board. It is not perfect, but it is a convenient way to avoid the use of images when creating documentation on different Chess positions. Using plain text saves a lot of space compared to the space required to make millions of Chess images for every possible move. The white pieces are represented with capital letters and the black by lowercase letters.

Of course, I don't intend to document every move that could occur in every Chess game. Instead, I want to cover those that happen in real games with humans. The idea is approximately one blog post per day where I analyze the board from my human perspective and then write what I think the best move is.

Unlike a Chess engine, I can explain the reason for my moves in a position. This could be used for future Chess books after I have written good explanations of why I recommend a move in a given position.

In any case, my recommended move from the starting position will always be d4, which means move the pawn in front of the white queen to d4.

Later on, I may cover openings starting with e4, but because they are too popular and overused, I will be sticking with my openings beginning with d4. The idea is one post per day because this is a small step that is easy to fit into my busy schedule.
