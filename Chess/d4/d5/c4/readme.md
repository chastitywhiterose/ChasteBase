# The Queen’s Gambit

The Queen’s Gambit sounds like a fancy name, and this name was used for a Netflix show as well. However, this opening was well known before people had televisions, computers, or the internet. The word “gambit” means sacrifice. In this opening white sacrifices a pawn with the hope of getting an advantage later. To some people, it also means a gamble because there is no way of knowing if it will work out the way you want depending on what your opponent does.

The opening starts with each side moving the pawn in front of their queen.
Then white moves the pawn on C2 to C4.

In this position, black’s pawn can capture the white pawn and yet it doesn’t appear that white can capture it back, at least not yet. If it does take the pawn, this is known as accepting the gambit. New players will more likely than not take this pawn if they don’t see the trap.

You see, the idea was to distract the pawn and move it away from the center so that white’s king pawn could move two squares forward. Also notice that the white bishop on F1 could also capture the black pawn on C4 next turn, but not so fast, first, black has to choose their next move. The only problem is that there really is no good way for black to stop white from taking their pawn with the bishop. If they try to protect it with another pawn, things can turn out badly. Sooner or later white will capture back the C4 pawn with the bishop and if black tries to stop it, they will only lose more pieces.

My best advice is that if you accept the Queen’s Gambit, also accept that you will lose this pawn and don’t try to defend it with by moving the b7 pawn to b5. This has never worked out well for my opponents. Do not let the sequence of the following images happen to you!

I also want you to notice that the previous sequence of moves would still be just as bad if white had decided to move their king's pawn only one space to e3. There are valid reasons they might do so to add extra protection to the d4 pawn. The d4 pawn is only protected by the queen right now so beware of this in all your games.

If you are the black player, I would recommend against accepting the Queen’s Gambit entirely. It leads to many traps by white. If you do accept it, you will lose your pawn anyway. Don’t waste time with that and instead move out other pawns depending on what pieces you plan to move. Below are the two most common responses to the Queen’s Gambit.

## Queen’s Gambit Declined

## Slav Defense

Both of these responses allow you to capture the white pawn back if it captures your D5 pawn. More importantly, you are getting pawns out of the way of your other pieces so that they can start attacking white. The Queen’s Gambit Declined is probably slightly better than the Slav Defense because moving the king’s pawn is just generally a great move because then black’s queen and dark squared bishop can move out diagonally and try to attack white.

But a final note is that accepting or declining the Queen’s Gambit does not lose for black by any means, but accepting it allows white to get both of their center pawns and allows them to start moving both bishops out very quickly. White already has the advantage, don’t give them more help if you are the black player. But if you are the white player, I have plenty of advice on what to do. However I may have to add more to this book later.

Now one thing you may have noticed is that the Queen’s Gambit started with moving the Queen’s Pawn (D4) instead of the King’s Pawn (E4) like in the previous example with the elaborate bishop sacrifice. Queen pawn openings are just far more fun to play because the game takes longer and my opponents get frustrated. E4 is better for quicker wins but is so cliché that I got tired of playing it and became a D4 player for my first move.
