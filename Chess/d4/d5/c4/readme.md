This position is called the Queen's Gambit. This opening is my favorite because it is a trap designed to fool the opponent into taking a pawn and then gain a huge advantage. Smart players will know to avoid taking the pawn on c4. However, I have written extensive information on what to do if they do accept the gambit.
