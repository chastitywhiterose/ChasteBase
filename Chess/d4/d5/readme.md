In this position, both queen pawns have moved two squares forward. When this happens, it is best to move a pawn to [c4](https://chastitywhiterose.github.io/ChasteBase/Chess/d4/d5/c4) and start the Queen's Gambit, or move a bishop to [Bf4](https://chastitywhiterose.github.io/ChasteBase/Chess/d4/d5/c4/Bf4) for the London System.
