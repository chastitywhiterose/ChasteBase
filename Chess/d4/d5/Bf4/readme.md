# The London System

I am not the first person to say that the London System is a solid opening. In fact it’s probably the best opening to teach a beginner who has decided they like to open the game with D4. The first move will always be D4. But the London System is actually quite different than the Queen's Gambit because your goal is not an early attack nor sacrificing pieces. The goal is to build a defensive structure. Look at the following picture.

It takes a total of 7 moves to achieve this setup but it can usually be done quite easily no matter what black does. If you don’t get this position on your side because you had a chance to take your opponent’s pieces because they made bad moves, then that should take priority over building this. For example, suppose that your opponent moves their king’s pawn two squares forward to E5, then just take it with your pawn!

It’s totally easy to see how a player might be used to moving their king’s pawn two squares and might mistakenly let white’s D4 pawn take it. This completely disabled black’s development besides costing them a pawn. They can’t move their knight to F6, nor can they move the pawn in front of their queen either one or two spaces (because of en passant rule). If black makes this mistake, then they already have a huge disadvantage. This is not like the Queen’s Gambit because there is no advantage to offering white a free pawn. If black does this, then take that pawn and then build the rest of the London Fortress even though there will be a missing pawn at the head of the pyramid of pawns. But most of the time, your opponent will not make a mistake as bad as the previous example. They will most likely do something smarter such as knight to F6.

In this position, we see that the black knight is trying to prevent our king’s pawn to e4. That’s totally fine because that is not what we will do in the London system. We will continue to build our setup. In this position we should next move the bishop to F4.

It’s worth mentioning that bishop to F5 would also be a good move, and would be called the Trompowsky attack. However, since I am teaching the London System, we will stick with bishop to F4 for now.

Because of the fact that we have disabled the enemy king’s pawn from moving two squares, most players will instead move their queen’s pawn two squares instead. Remember, moving the pawns in front of the king or queen is almost always a good idea. With that in mind, our next move should be pawn to E3 because this is the next step in building the pawn pyramid, and it also adds an extra defender to the E4 pawn and Bishop.

Keep in mind that this is still early in the game and that chess openings only take you so far. However, white has a really good winning chance in this setup. For example, black may try to offer the black version of the Queen’s Gambit by pawn to C5. However, doing so allows us to take their knight on B8!

The rook can take our bishop but we have eliminated one of the enemy knights. You may be wondering, why sacrifice the bishop to take down a knight? The reason I do this is because in my experience, knights are better than bishops. Each chess player has different opinions on this, but here is my own reasoning on why knights are more powerful than bishops.

1. Two knights can defend each other, unlike bishops which are always on different colored squares.
2. Knight attacks cannot be blocked, they are therefore better for checkmating in many cases I have seen.
3. Knights look like horses, which are my favorite animal. I prefer to protect my horses.

Maybe you disagree with me, in case you would not follow my advice. However, the main point is that to play the London System, you should get your pieces out similar to the picture of the 7 moves

So far, all of what I have talked about so far is openings that white chooses to play. If you are the black player, what should you do? For one thing, you can expect that white will most likely play E4 for their first move, so I will next cover the French Defense.
