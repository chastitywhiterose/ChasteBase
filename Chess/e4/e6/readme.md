# The French Defense

The French Defense is my main opening when playing as the black player. I will make the case for why it deserves more credit as an opening even though it is less popular than the Caro Kann(which may be covered later)

This is the start of the French Defense. White has moved king's pawn to e4 and we are moving our king's pawn only one square instead of the usual two.

I know it looks weird and uncomforable to move a pawn only one square when it could have moved two, but the reason for this will become clear very soon.

Almost all the time, white will move their queen's pawn two squares and in this case you will copy them.

In this position, white has the option of capturing the d5 black pawn. If they take it, it is called the exchange variation of the French Defense. White will capture the pawn but then we capture it right back. Then the board will look like this.

As the black player, this is precisely what you wanted to happen because now the path is open for you to move either of your bishops or your queen out if you need to.

The other alternative is when white does not take the pawn and instead advances it to e5.

This is called the advanced variation of the French Defense. Not because it is advanced in the sense of complicated but because the white pawn has advanced instead of capturing. When this happens, the best thing to do is to move a pawn to c5 and offer the "black queen's gambit" and hope that white takes it so you can capture back with the bishop. From that point the game continues like normal and it follows much of the same logic as I use when I play the Queen's Gambit.

For example, the following sequence of images shows exactly how a checkmate can happen quickly if white does not defend the weak f2 square next to their king.

Obviously, the game doesn't always end this quickly but as you see the French Defense is based on the same logic as the Queen's Gambit by offering a pawn with the hope of lining the bishop and the queen up to attack the weak square. At the least, this will put the king on the run, and sometimes even a checkmate if your opponent doesn't defend correctly.
