# Welcome to ChasteBase

This website is created with Github Pages. It is my largest project yet but the idea is simple. Each Chess position will have the notation for the moves and also my notes on the possible moves in that position. There is no way this can be done for every position because the combinations are infinite.

However, some positions will show up more often than others!

Although this site is dedicated to standard Chess. Other games like Shogi and Xiangqi may be added eventually.
